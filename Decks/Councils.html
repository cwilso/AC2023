</section>

<section class="slide cover clear" id=prologue>
	<h2>Prologue</h2>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=xp>
	<h3>Councils as an Experiment</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A promising approach
		<li class=next>But with much uncertainty
		<li class=next>Ran as an experiment under Director delegation
		<li class=next>Process Drafts and practices adjusted based on learnings
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=history>
	<h3>Councils so Far</h3>
	<p>Documented on a <a href="https://beta.w3.org/about/council/">dedicated report page</a>:
	<ul>
		<li>November 2020: Devices and Sensors Working Group Charter
		<li>May 2022: Web Applications Security Working Group Charter
		<li>August 2022: Payment Request API Recommendation
		<li>November 2022: Devices and Sensors Working Group Charter
		<li>March 2023: Timed Text Working Group Charter
	</ul>

<section class="slide cover clear" id=act-1>
	<h2>Act I</h2>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=c-1>
	<h3>1<sup>st</sup> Council</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/about/council/#2020-11-24-das">November 2020: Devices and Sensors Working Group Charter</a>
	<p class=note>Objection against a rechartering, based on technical concerns &amp; implementation interest
	<p class=next>
	Learnings:
	<ul>
		<li class=next>Need a detailed team report upfront
		<li class=next>Expose our thinking
		<li class=next>Don't prescribe solutions, but do give hints<br>
			<p class=note> (e.g. Valid concerns which are non blocking at (re)chartering stage, but would be when trying to go to REC)
	</ul>

</section>

<section class="slide" id=sub-group>
	<h3>Special Provision: Sub-group deliberation</h3>
	From <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#council-deliberations">5.6.2.6. Council Deliberations</a></cite>
	<blockquote>
		A Council may form sub-groups for deliberation, who may return with a recommendation, but the full Council issues the final decision.
	</blockquote>
	<p class=next>
		‚Üí Handles cases needing time-consuming in depth investigations,
		where not everyone is needed at all steps
</section>

<section class="slide cover clear" id=inter-1>
	<h2>Interlude</h2>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=consensus>
	<h3>Consensus</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Voluntary standards
		<li>Cannot impose anything on anyone
		<li>People will only implement what they accept (‚â† prefer)
		<li>‚Üí Key motivation for operating by consensus
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=dissent>
	<h3>Disregarding dissent?</h3>
	<p>Routine decisions by simple majority:
	<ul>
		<li class=next>Large minorities routinely dissatisfied
		<li class=next>Still not be bound by the outcome
		<li class=next>Might leave
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=forward>
	<h3>Finding a Solution</h3>
	<p>Formal Objection = lack of consensus = natural blocker
	<p class=next>
	An FO handling mechanism enables principled decisions acceptable to the community despite no consensus.
	<p class=next><em>NOT</em> unbiased decision about right vs wrong, guilty vs innocent.<br>
	‚Üí Informed and principled decision for a best way forward.
</section>

<section class="slide" id=recusals>
	<h3>Recusals Based on Conflict of Interest?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Subject to pressure and intimidation
		<li class=next>Conflicts of interest are subjective:
			<ul>
				<li>Nobody on the AB/TAG/Team is indifferent about the W3C or the Web
				<li>AC Reps, editors, chairs: collective or individual views?
				<li>Agreeing with someone: conflict of interest?
				<li>Having known views: conflict of interest?
			</ul>
		<li class=next>Each person judged on different criteria: their own<br>
			‚Üí Would exclude people who care about conflicts of interests as much as than people who have them
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=automatic>
	<h3>Automatic Exclusion?</h3>
	<p> Predefined strict rules are easily worked around
	<p class=next>Potential objectors on the AB or TAG could find someone to proxy their Objection
</section>

<section class="slide" id=dismiss>
	<h3>Dismissal</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class=next>After discovery and disclosure
		<li class=next>Everybody is judged by the same (collective) criteria, no bias against the principled
		<li class=next>Allows for removing deeply problematic cases, while generally preserving breadth, diversity, and electoral representivity
</section>
<section class="slide" id=practice>
	<h3>In Practice?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li class=next>All Councils decided by consensus
		<li class=next>Proponents of ‚Äúone side‚Äù have been constructive
		<li class=next>Typically pre-announce going with the Group‚Äôs conclusions
	</ul>

	<p class=note>Objection against a rechartering, based on technical concerns &amp; implementation interest
	<p class=next>Not fully repetitive, but broadly similar with earlier case
	<p class=next>
	Strengthens case for documenting reasoning:
	<ul>
		<li class=next>
			Predictability of outcome informs future discussions
		<li class=next>
			May spawn valuable debate in the community
		<li class=next>
			May influence elections
	</ul>

	From <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#council-short-circuit">5.6.2.4. Unanimous Short Circuit</a></cite>

	</blockquote>
	<p class=next>‚Üí Handles duplicative or abusive cases.

<section class="slide cover clear" id=inter-2>
	<h2>Interlude</h2>

<section class="slide" id=short>
	<h3>Why so Long Delays Before Council Starts?</h3>
	<p  style="text-align: center">üôá Sorry! üôá
	<ul>
		<li class=next>Team and AB distracted by Legal Entity planning<br>
		‚Üí No longer current
		<li class=next>Processed serially rather than in parallel<br>
		‚Üí Don't do that
		<li class=next>AB asked for confirmation before starting each case<br>
		‚Üí Don't do that

	<p class=next>Learnings:

	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id=delegation>
	<h3>Special Provision: Delegation</h3>
	From <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#council-delegation">5.6.2.2. Extraordinary Delegation</a></cite>

		In extraordinary cases, [‚Ä¶] a member of the Team [‚Ä¶] or any potential Council member may suggest that the decision [‚Ä¶] be delegated to the W3C Board of Directors, to an officer of its corporation (such as the Legal Counsel), or to one or more specific individuals from the Team.
