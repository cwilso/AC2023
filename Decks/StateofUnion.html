    Ralph: we are a worldwide consortium, and we remain so,<br>

    David: Thank you, Ralph<br>
    Integration is a significant theme underlying our actions<br>
    I have heard too many sentences over the last few years <br>
      in which the team, Hosts, or members were referred to using 'them',<br>
      There is no 'them', it is all 'us'. We are one W3C, one consortium, working together<br>
    There is a renewed push in our sector to reach all peoples; <br>
      it's important that we look at our structures and approaches <br>
      to people's cultures, languages, scripts and the inclusion of all people:<br>
      We are building one web for one humanity, one World<br>
    Finally, some of us have been digging into history:<br>
      some of our structures were designed to enable the launching of the web decades ago<br>
      we need to look at and revise our structures to optimize around building its future today<br>

    David: Ralph mentioned our new legal structure. Where are we in the incorporation?<br>
    We are an incorporated legal entity, with a Board (that I chair)<br>
    Our Hosts, <br>
      who in a sense defined the consortium before, and had significant independence<br>
      are becoming Partners, working together more closely as one W3C<br>
    So, with this transition and the transition of Tim's retirement, what does governance look like?

    David: Let's look at how we govern our technical operations.<br>
    One unusual aspect of our structure is that this new Board does NOT have direct oversight of the technical program<br>
    So though this looks complex, don't panic: you know this & it's not changing<br>
    Let me walk you through this briefly as a refresher<br>
    Now I'm going to show how this WAS integrated with overall governance, and then I will show what's new<br>
    <br>
    The W3C members name representatives to the advisory committee (AC),
      elect to the TAG and AB, and appoint to working groups.
    The AC approves charters (and document progression)
    The AB oversees the governing Process document
    The TAG defines architectural principles and oversees technical integrity
    Work groups produce our primary product: Recommendations
    <strong>and the Team supports the entire organization.</strong><br>
    Not shown: formal objections and escalation

    David: How did this integrate with operational governance?<br>
    The Director was the formal 'root' of governance;<br>
      The AC advised the Director,<br>
      who was also advised by a steering committee of the hosts, and of course by the Team<br>
    The Director had oversight of the CEO<br>
    The steering committee coordinated the Hosts<br>
    Management of the team was jointly the CEO and the Hosts<br>

    David: What does governance look like now and into the future?<br>
    A short phrase we have used is to say we are becoming more member-led: that's you - that's Us!<br>
      previously the members were not much involved in the formal governance side<br>
    One aspect of incorporation is that we HAVE a Board of Directors, 
      with formal authority over governance: legal, money, and operational matters<br>
    The members elect the largest class to the Board of Directors<br>
      the Partners also appoint, and there is provision for Board-appointed seats<br>
      The Board oversees the CEO directly, and coordinates the Partners<br>
    Under the Partnership model, 
      the Partners continue to employ most of the team<br>
      the team is more closely coordinated as a single world-wide team under the CEO<br>
    This is what we're becoming: a consortium where the members (on one side) and the staff 
      (on the other) work together to lead us – lead the web – forward

    David: So who is on the Board?<br>
    You'll be meeting them tomorrow; there is a panel session of the Board<br>
      (and one of the AB also)<br>
    MIT had a seat until the end of 2022; their seat is now vacant and appointable<br>
    We have made one appointment, and one appointable seat also remains<br>
    The Board's first meeting on Oct 20th was very close to the formal transition date of Dec 31st<br>
    There have been and still are a lot of matters needing immediate attention<br>
    They are not all resolved, but we are increasingly turning from those<br>
      to questions of the longer term, strategy and policy<br>
    The Board is still getting up to speed, finding its feet, in somewhat of a firey birth<br>

    David: I mentioned some short-term items that remain unfininished, and some longer-term ones we feel we should address<br>
    Clearly we're in catch-up on Partner agreements and budgets this year, and we have not yet quite finished<br>
    And this year, uniquely, we have to negotiate the transition from the Hosted model and the 2023 deferred revenue<br>
    But…the Partner agreements envisage a budget cycle that ends in agreement well before the year starts<br>
    which means we need to start the 2024 budget cycle now<br>
    and lastly, we are not getting to you or the Board all the visibility and reports we'd like, on finance and membership<br>
    For the longer term, we need to ask whether our membership structures, tiers, and dues, would benefit from revision<br>
    we clearly would benefit from a reserve<br>
    and we're aware that we're strong in countries where we have Partners but we may need to strengthen our presence in the rest of the world;<br>
    there is a session on Chapters, which is an early part of that exploration<br>
    Ralph, let's talk about this change from Hosts to Partners

    Ralph: We've mentioned this conceptual change from Host to Partner<br>
    But what does it mean?<br>
    As we already mentioned, our 'founding Host', MIT, has for years been encouraging us 
      to progress forward from being one of MIT's research projects<br>
    MIT launched W3C, with some help, and provided us a stable home for nearly 3 decades 
      and for that we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.
    MIT still houses a vital part of our Web Accessibility work 
      but has decided not to continue as a formal Partner.<br>
    In Japan there is a new Foundation that is now the formal Partner; 
      that foundation continues to work with Keio University 
      while some of the team remain at the University<br>
    We have interim partner agreements with ERCIM and Beihang 
      while the precise details of their Partner agreement are in the process of resolution<br>
    One key change in these new arrangements is that the Board has overall budgetary control,<br>
      and with the exception of China, we are collecting member dues centrally<br>
      and coordinating their expenditure globally

    Ralph: In addition to MIT, the other big debt of gratitude is, of course, to our Founding Director<br>
    As you saw in the Governance diagrams, 
      to a large extent Tim's governance role has been subsumed by the Board<br>
      and his oversight of technical matters largely subsumed by existing member structures:<br>
        The AC, AB and TAG<br>
    Process 2023 proposed that Tim retains life seats on both the Board and TAG<br>
