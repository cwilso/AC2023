  <section class=comment>
   <p>Hi, Chris Wilson again.  I am actually here now to do two things: I'm going to talk about incubation in just a minute, but first I want to call out what bridges the three topics we have here together: the workflow of standards.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide" id="lists">
   <h2>The workflow of standards</h2>
   <p>Ideas ====> ??? ====> Standards
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p> If you think of the general process of standards in a simplified way, there are ideas at one end, they go through some set of processes, and then ultimately there are standards created.  All three of these talks refer to different parts of what we need to do to improve that process; from how to incubate and when to go to standards, to how to figure out which ideas. I'll start by talking about incubating new ideas, and some of the challenges there; Dingwei will talk about a proposal to improve how we as a community look at exploring new spaces, and then Ian will talk about how the Team is looking at evaluating big strategic topics.</p>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>This has been an AB priority since 2020 It has appeared on our list. We file an issue about it back in blah blah blah. We had a breakout on at least a teapot last year. I think it have had ones that previous. I didn't know we've had ones at TPAC who put in a reference to the TPAC meeting. In 2016 that I chaired.
Chris Wilson: so this topic has been around for a really long time and perhaps we've been busy with other things maybe. and that's okay. But I finally got around to writing an initial summary for discussion in The Advisory Board. We had that discussion earlier this year. We then hosted a session at Breakout day and I want to be clear. I don't have any magic answers for Today why we haven't solved incubation. I wanted to give a summary of some of the things that we have talked about the important bullet points and use that as kind of a framing onto the next round of information.</p>

   <h2>Still very much an open discussion</h2>
   <p>I will not be giving you any magic answers today.  :)

   <p>I want to be clear, I do not have any conclusions or answers today; this is just providing some framing for what problem I think we need to discuss.</p>

   <h2>The point of Web standards is interoperability</h2>
   <p>The point of making web standards is to enable and ensure interoperability.<p>
    <p>If we call something a "web standard" that doesn’t work across multiple implementations and thus doesn’t work across the web, it's a disservice to users. The Web has “interoperability across multiple implementations” bound in its DNA. </p>
    <p>However, it is rare that a novel idea will immediately get support from multiple implementers, before even being explored; incubation is a way of exploring a new problem space or use case, without committing to a particular solution, or even committing to ultimately solving the problem. 
Interoperability is not the immediate goal of incubation.

  <section class=comment>
   <p>Chris Wilson: fundamentally, the point of having building web standards at all is interoperability. We need to enable and ensure interoperability. If we call something a web standard and it doesn't work across multiple implementations doesn't work therefore. And therefore doesn't work across the entire web. That's a disservice to users. The web has interoperability across multiple implementations built into its DNA. It is critical that if we call something a web standard it is supported. Not just in one place not just one browser one infrastructure one system, but that it's a common piece of technology. However It's very rare that a novel idea immediately gets support from multiple implementers.
Chris Wilson: Even before it's deeply p Incubation is a way of exploring a new problem space or use case without committing to a particular solution or really even committing to ultimately solving the problem. Interoperability isn't the immediate goal of incubation looking at a problem coming up with a solution to Testing it out and seeing how well it solves. The problem is the point of incubation.
00:10:00
Chris Wilson: To incubation one of my colleagues a long long time ago. a long long time ago gave me a piece of advice that
Chris Wilson: I still remember to this day. I have a Post- those of you who know me, I keep a set of Post-it notes I manage work items with Post-it notes on my monitor and some of these Post-it notes have gotten very old point where they've fallen off and they no longer stick. So I store them in a drawer somewhere, but there are a few that I keep for a long period of time usually this is my organization system if I've ignored something for long enough for it to fall off my monitor. I don't need to do it.
Chris Wilson: But I have one for many years ago that one of my colleagues to meet you to askoff said don't fall in love with your first good idea. And this is good advice and an underpins incubations are a start to something. They're testing things out. They're not the same as even your initial first published working graph of the standard because you could be completely wrong. You could have a bad idea and you need to know that now after you've explored this though incubations</p>

  <section class="slide" id="elements">
   <h2>Where do we go from Incubation</h2>
   <p>
Incubation should be an on-ramp to "graduating" to working groups with consensus, IPR, and consistent horizontal review. The goal of incubation is to improve the pace of iteration before the formal standards processes and requirements kick in. Formal standardization through working groups requires charters that pre-determine the deliverables of the group, but that's far too much commitment when brainstorming new ideas and trying things out.

</p>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>we need to have an on-ramp a very specific pattern to graduating to working groups with consensus and IPR rules and consistent horizontal review and all of these things the goal of incubation is to improve the pace of iteration before those.
Chris Wilson: Disease kick in but we still need all of those processes and choosing the right point for that is definitely one of the hard parts.

  <section class="slide" id="incremental1">
   <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>How should incubation work? How should an incubation group be communicating their work to a broader venue to ease acceptance as a WG deliverable?</li>
      <li>How should Working Group charters refer to incubation and future work? What best practices should we define for referring to incubations? What kind of timeline for deliverables are a good idea when work migrates into a WG?</li>
      <li>What expectation of incubation should there be before work is accepted into a WG, or into its charter? At what stage of "doneness" should work move from an incubation venue to a working group? How can we identify the "right" time to migrate an incubation to a WG?</li>
      <li>What success criteria should there be for incubations? What defines success in this context? What happens to incubations that are successfully defined and adopted in one engine, but not picked up by any other implementers?
</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>Chris Wilson: I wanted to raise a number of questions that we had. For consideration. again. I don't have answers to these questions. I think they're interesting questions and they're what we have to solve in order to make the pattern of incubation and the ramp to standards really work much better and you'll see I think how this ties together with the other talks. How should incubation work how does an how does an incubation group know when hey we're ready for this to be a working group, but this can happen too It can happen too late. It can happen when no other implementations are really interested. But you're still evaluated the entire problem.
Chris Wilson: How should this factor into working group Charters and should working group Charters as some do today refer to incubation before standardization what best practice should we use for saying things it could be first? And what kind of timeline should this look like? It used to be that we would create a working group and say Here's a use case. We want to go solve it. And we put a timeline on it. And today we tend to be a lot more thoughtful about things we tend to say okay, let's make sure we've tested out that there is a solution here that could holds to our principles and everything What expectation of incubation should we have before Works accepted into a charter and finally, of course crime? What is success look like for incubations?
Chris Wilson: Is it incubation a success even if it fails to s.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p> I want to pass the Baton over to my colleagues way and I am Jacobs to talk about some different perspectives ding way first to talk about how we as members think we should participate more and exploring big topics new ideas and sort of generating ideas even for incubation.
Chris Wilson: and then I and Jacobs will get up and talk about what the team is doing to improve their strategic.
Chris Wilson: their exploring strategic things Thank you.
