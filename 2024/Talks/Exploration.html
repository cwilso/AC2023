   <h3>This Group is intended to address several use cases:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>New ideas and dimensions:</strong> a new human step may impact the Web, e.g. "autonomous L4/L5 cars", "one continent forking the technology stack of the Internet and the Web", "sustainable blockchain", "6G Networks";</li>
    <li><strong>New people</strong>: a welcoming point for people who are unfamiliar with our processes and systems, to understand the organization;</li>
