  <section class=comment>
   <p>Hi, I'm Chris Wilson, AC member from Google, member of the Advisory Board, and editor/chair of the Vision effort.  I promise this session will be brief; I'm not here to give a long boring update of everything we've worked on in the Vision Task Force, or even deep-dive into the Vision principles; we have a breakout talk tomorrow to discuss that level of detail.  I'm here because I. I'm only in front of you now because the Vision is a really good way to frame all the work we collectively do at W3C, and it's a good way to put all the talks here at the AC meeting into a common context.   Although the Vision document is a work started by the AB to describe W3C, the goal we have is to unite the mission we are all on, by representing shared values of the W3C community, which in turn will guide the community’s work.</p>

  <section class="slide" id="why-vision">
   <h2>Why do we need a Vision?</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>We need principles to help guide us without a Director</li>
    <li>Growing privacy and other ethical concerns on the web</li>
    <li>Continued growth and importance of the Web in the world around us</li>
    <li>We must improve the integrity and trustworthiness of the Web</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>It is particularly important at this point in W3C's history to have a shared Vision statement - partly because make up for no longer having a singular Director, by building a set of modern grounded community values, to help consistently guide W3C's decisions, but also because there have been growing problems on the web - privacy and other ethical concerns, as well as unprecedented growth in the importance of the Web to the world around us.</p>
   <p>We feel we must improve the integrity and trustworthiness of the web, because the credibility for W3C's future needs to come from our community consensus.</p>

  <section class="slide slide-in" id="vision-web">
   <h2>Vision for the Web</h2>
   <ul class=zwith-icons>
    <li><!--<img src="piechart.png" alt="pie chart"> -->The Web is for all humanity.</li>
    <li>The Web is designed for the good of its users.</li>
    <li>The Web must be safe for its users.</li>
    <li>There is one interoperable world-wide Web.</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>Before we get into the vision of what W3C is, we needed to sketch out what we believe underlies the Web itself; this is clearly a space filled by the TAG’s Ethical Web Principles, which you’ll hear more about later today from Dan; these basic points come from that document: The web is for all Humanity. The web is designed for the good of its users, and it must be safe for those users; finally, there is one single interoperable worldwide web.  This is a great groundwork for the Web...

  <section class="slide" id="vision-w3c">
   <h2>Vision for W3C</h2>
   <p>  W3C leads the community in defining a World Wide Web that puts users first, by developing technical standards and guidelines to empower an equitable, informed, and interconnected society.</p>
   <p>The fundamental function of W3C today is to provide an open forum where diverse voices from around the world and from different organizations and industries work together to evolve the web by building consensus on voluntary global standards for Web technologies.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>... and what we needed to do from there was articulate the vision for w3c itself: that W3C is leading the community to define a web that puts users first, by developing standards and guidelines to empower an equitable informed and interconnected society.</p>
   <p>The fundamental function of w3c is really to provide an open forum where a whole lot of diverse voices from around the world different organizations different Industries can work together to evolve the web by building consensus on our voluntary web standards</p>

   </div>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>Now the vision document goes into a lot more detail into specific principles and values that we need to apply and to some degree how we need to apply this. I don't want to go into each one of those here in detail; I want you to go read the Vision instead.  It should be no suprise that we are user first, that we're multi-stakeholder, that diversity is important to us, that we need to work to avoid centralization. These principles should run through all of the work that we do together at W3C; if it doesn't, we probably don't have the vision quite right yet.</p>
  </section>

 <section class="slide" id="status">
   <h2>Status</h2>
   <p>The Advisory Board has published the Vision as a Note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-w3c-vision-20240403/">https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-w3c-vision-20240403/</a>. </p>
   <p>We continue to work in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/AB-public/">github.com/w3c/AB-public/</a>.</p>
   <p>We are working toward asking for your endorsement as a Statement soon.</p> 
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>With that in mind, the Advisory Board published the Vision last week as a Note. This means that we have consensus on it inside The Advisory Board; although we know we're not quite done yet, and still have some issues to resolve. We are continuing to work through our GitHub repository - so you can file issues and participate in the discussion there. We're not quite ready to ask for the AC's endorsement as a Statement (Dan's going to talk a little bit more about that process later too), but that will be soon, hopefully by the end of the year.</p>

  <section class="slide" id="conclusion">
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>These principles are intended to guide W3C to ensure the Web fulfills its Vision, to empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society.</p>
   <p>Please review <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/w3c-vision/">https://www.w3.org/TR/w3c-vision/</a>!</p>

  <section class=comment>
   <p> So in conclusion, these principles are intended to guide w3c to ensure the web fulfills its Vision to empower that equitable, informed and interconnected society. I do want to ask you to please review the Vision document, and call out any high-level concerns you have about it. As I said, we have a breakout session on the vision tomorrow, or of course you may always approach myself or Tantek, or comment on the Github - the feedback link is in the Vision itself.  Thank you very much; and with that framing, I want to hand it over to David.</p>
